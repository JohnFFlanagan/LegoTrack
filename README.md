# LegoTrack

Lego like track of various shapes including straight, curved, and crossing.
The separate parts of the crossing can be generated to use on a Lego track.

The "test" type generates a single tie that allows you to set "pin", "post", and "stud" parameters for your printer.  I you want to change connector parameters create a straight track 2 or 3 in length.

Straight and curve tracks can have a guard/check/Crossing Flange added for, example, track on a bridge.

This is good but not as good as LEGO® brand track.  This code intends to allow a track to be created that you can not just buy.

For example, you need a radius of 40 turn of 11.25 degrees to complete the rail you have laid down.  Or you want a guard/check rail on the inside of a turn.

This code supports narrow track.  However, I have never actually seen a narrow track so there may need to be lots of fixes.  Also, there appear to be two types of connectors for narrow, this only supports the wider spacing.

I started with other people's code.  Among them:
	LEGO.scad (github) Christopher Finke
	Lego Narrow Gauge Track by Ortwin
	Lego City train track compatible Curved V2 by Mtudury

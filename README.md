# LegoTrack

Lego like track of various shapes including straight, curved, and crossing.
The seperate parts of the crossing can be generated to use on Lego track. 

Many of these can have a guard/check/Crossing Flang added for, example, track on a bridge.

This is good but not as good as LEGO® brand track.  The intention of this code is to allow track to be created that you can not just buy.

For example you need a radius 40 turn of 11.25 degrees to complete rail you have layed down.  Or you want a guard/check rail on the inside of a turn.

This code support narrow track.  However I have never actually seen a narrow track so there may need to be lots of fixes.

I stared with other peoples code.  Among them:
	LEGO.scad (github) Christopher Finke
	Lego Narrow Gauge Track by ortwin
	Lego City train track compatible Curved V2 by mtudury
